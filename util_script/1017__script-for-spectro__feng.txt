After the bacteria have produced fluoresecnt proteins in response to a chemical cue/signgal, it is then meausured optically using a spectroscopy chip, capable of separating visible light into 6 channels of different colors. This is cruical in that it removes background lighting, including the excitation light and other possible contamination. For the prototype. an elevated amount of GFP would translate into an increased proportion of green light. This proportion is then compared to a reference proportion obtained from a solution that was not exposed to the chemical signal, so that we are confident the observed elevation is not just noise. Moreover, Spectre plus offers a wireless solution, so that the device does not need wiring to record the data. This comes in handy for gastroignal application in the future, where a wireless design means one can simply ingest the device without getting choked.
